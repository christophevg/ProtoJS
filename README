ProtoJS is a set of JavaScript language extensions focusing on the
language itself, rather than trying to overcome browser issues. It's
aim is to increase development productivity, with a minimal overhead
(read: size).  ...

Note: I'm trying to get things as polished as possible, but my current
focus is on a project that uses ProtoJS. When that reaches a stable
state, I'll add documentation and examples here also :-)

In a nutshell:
$ make

Visit examples/ with your browser to see things in action and
while waiting for me to write decent documentation, study the code.
