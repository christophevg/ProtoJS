ProtoJS is a set of JavaScript language extensions focusing on the
language itself, rather than trying to overcome browser issues. It's
aim is to increase development productivity, with a minimal overhead
(read: size).

In a nutshell:
$ make
$ make test
...
-----------------------
98 tests run.
0 failed.

REMARK: Sometimes one test fails. It has to do with timing and I have
to fine-tune it. Just run the tests again and it will mostly be gone.

Visit examples/ with your browser to see things in action and
while waiting for me to write decent documentation, study the code ;-)
